# Rocket_RL
Reinforcement learning agent that runs fluid dynamics simulations for rocket engines

This package presently imports fluid dynamics simulation data and plots the best-defined features. 

RocketRL.main.py is the main function that calls the other scripts and data.
RocketRL_params.py has all of the parameters & is called by the main function
RocketRL_funcs_data.py has all of the data importing, processing, and visualization functions

To run:
1. set home_dir in main & params folders
2. put data1.csv into a \data folder
3. put all code into a \code folder
